## What can you do with Mosamatic Insights?

Doing clinical research requires data. This data can be structured, like clinical characteristics you store
in a table, or unstructured, like images or sequencing data. The purpose of clinical research is to answer
one or more relevant clinical questions and then try to use these answers in clinical practice in order to 
better help patients. 
Before you can even begin working with data, you first need (1) to know where the data is located and (2)
have permission to use it. We're not considering these stages here. Other than that, from a data 
perspective clinical research requires five stages:

(1) Data collection and storage
(2) Data exploration and understanding
(3) Data preparation
(4) Data analysis
(5) Data reporting and visualization

Clinical researchers, in principle, know which questions they want to answer. This means that, in principle,
they know about analysis, reporting and probably visualization of the analysis results. What they may not
know is how to properly organize data storage. They may know how to do exploratory data analysis on structured
data but have a very hard time doing the same with unstructured data. They may not know how to properly 
prepare their data for analysis. All these areas are the domain of data engineering and require significant 
programming skills to handle in a reproducible and traceable manner. Stages 1, 2 and 3 are the areas where a 
data scientist or engineer can contribute the most to the research effort. 

So how do you get clinical research at the surgery lab to a higher level? By letting people do the analyses
they want, the way they want but making sure that their data is ready to be analyzed. Data collection,
storage, exploration/understanding and preparation are the areas where you can make a difference as a data 
scientist.
